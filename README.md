# Sinusoidal_Dataset_generation
This project generates a synthetic dataset for training inverse kinematics models of a 6-DOF robotic arm. Joint angles are modeled with sinusoidal functions to simulate smooth and realistic human like motion patterns. It is ideal for training models like ANN to solve inverse kinematics efficiently.
